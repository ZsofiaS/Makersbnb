![Spaced Out](images/spacedout_logo.png)

Air B'n'B on an INTERGALACTIC scale. Our users take advantage of our state of the art web app to book short term accomodation in locations around the universe. From Saturn to Pluto, from the centre of the Andromeda nebula to the ends of the Milky Way, Spaced Out is where its at for your non-terrestrial travel needs!  
The app is deployed [here](https://spacedout-makers-bnb.herokuapp.com/users/log-in).

## Spec

- Any signed-up user can list a new space.
- Users can list multiple spaces.
- Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
- Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
- Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user - that owns that space.
- Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
